🧠 Problem Statement

Millions of skilled workers (like tutors, plumbers, designers, tailors) struggle to connect with potential clients in their local area. Existing platforms are either limited to metro cities, charge high fees, or don’t empower freelancers directly.

**SkillLinker** solves this by allowing:
- 🔍 **Seekers** to post custom job requests.
- 👷 **Providers** to match with jobs in their area.
- 💬 Both to chat, schedule, and transact securely — all in one app.

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** (JWT + Bcrypt)
- 🌍 **Geo-location based skill matching**
- 💬 **Real-time chat** using Socket.IO
- 📅 **Smart scheduling** & availability calendar
- 📍 **Interactive map-based browsing** (Mapbox)
- 🧠 **Skill-based recommendation engine**
- 💳 **(Optional)** Secure payment integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
- 📊 **Admin dashboard** with real-time analytics
- 🌙 **Dark mode with toggle switch** & responsive UI
